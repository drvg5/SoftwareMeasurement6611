# Evolution of the Maintainability in Open Source Office Collaboration Tools

In this project, we examine the evolution of metrics by mining the software repositories of open source office productivity softwares. 
The metrics help to describe the evolution of the maintainability in these type of softwares and as a result, we gain insight as to why changes may have occurred in our quality attribute of concern.

To achieve this, we will be using the widely used maintainability index proposed by Paul Oman and Jack Hagemeister together with the maintainability model proposed by Ilja Heitlager, Tobias Kuipers, and Joost Visser from the software improvement group.

In the end, we hope that these two models will help identify key aspects of the implementation of these systems that may have affected maintainability across the different versions of the systems under review.
